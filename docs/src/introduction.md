Introduction
============

This handbook is a guide to ordinal theory. Ordinal theory concerns itself with
litoshis, giving them individual identities and allowing them to be tracked,
transferred, and imbued with meaning.

Litoshis, not litecoin, are the atomic, native currency of the Litecoin network.
One litecoin can be sub-divided into 100,000,000 litoshis, but no further.

Ordinal theory does not require a sidechain or token aside from Litecoin, and
can be used without any changes to the Litecoin network. It works right now.

Ordinal theory imbues litoshis with numismatic value, allowing them to be
collected and traded as curios.

Individual litoshis can be inscribed with arbitrary content, creating unique
Litecoin-native digital artifacts that can be held in Litecoin wallets and
transferred using Litecoin transactions. Inscriptions are as durable, immutable,
secure, and decentralized as Litecoin itself.

Other, more unusual use-cases are possible: off-chain colored-coins, public key
infrastructure with key rotation, a decentralized replacement for the DNS. For
now though, such use-cases are speculative, and exist only in the minds of
fringe ordinal theorists.

For more details on ordinal theory, see the [overview](overview.md).

For more details on inscriptions, see [inscriptions](inscriptions.md).

When you're ready to get your hands dirty, a good place to start is with
[inscriptions](guides/inscriptions.md), a curious species of digital artifact
enabled by ordinal theory.
